# CHATLY 💬

A chat application that helps to connect you with friends and family.

## Reason For Project
I wanted to learn how websockets work, so why not build a chat app? Initially, I planned on building a mobile app but abandoned the project for about 4 months due to my final year project. Right now, I am focused on completing the web app and then hosting it. Afterwards, I want to shift my focus to mobile development with React Native.
